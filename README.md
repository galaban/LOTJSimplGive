# Galaban's Simple Give
This is a very simple plugin that will override the "give" command so that if you are not close to the player/mob that you want to give something to, you will automatically approach that player/mob.

To bypass this, just change your "give" command to "giv" and it will not use this plugin.  Conversely, if you usually type "giv", you'll have to learn how to add that "e" on there to get this to work.

This is for the Legends of the Jedi mud.

## To install
1. Download the raw file from github:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/galaban/LOTJSimpleGive/master/galabans_simple_give.xml
2. Place the raw file into your "plugins" directory.  This is found in your Mushclient folder under /worlds/plugins.
3. Install the plugain in MushClient.  From the "File" menu, choose "plugins", then "Add".  Select the file and choose "OK".

Note: This plugin does not require the MSDPHelper plugin, but it does improve the plugin a tiny bit.  (fixing problems if you start to give something to someone and then leave the room.)
